                    Many small and micro businesses in India face a huge
                    obstacle to their progress â€“ lack of access to capital. Many
                    of them are in unorganized sectors, do not maintain detailed
                    business accounts, do not have any credit history and loan
                    needs are often very small. Formal credit providers have
                    shunned them because it is not easy to underwrite these
                    loans.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Aye has picked up the gauntlet to break this vicious cycle.
                    As the conventional data sets were not available, we
                    pioneered a method that relies on using the unique patterns
                    of an industry cluster backed by our time-tested data
                    science models. Our ability to underwrite these 'edge'
                    cases, where little formal data exists, differentiates us in
                    our markets.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Our strength goes beyond just technology. We have a deep
                    branch network and a large team spread across the country.
                    Our 'high tech, high-touch' approach has helped us reimagine
                    and expand the boundaries of possibilities for our unique
                    clientele.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We have gone beyond being a lender and helped these
                    businesses in market development, quality management and
                    financial competence. Thanks to this all-round approach, we
                    have seen positive social impact in cross-sectional studies
                    done to evaluate the impact on our customers.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We do not want to be merely recognized for what we have done
                    but also for how we have done it. We will not hesitate to
                    explore and experiment, we will keep our customers at the
                    center of all that we do, we will always be honest and
                    worthy of trust placed in us by our investors and regulators
                    and we will always strive to make a difference to the
                    communities we serve.
                  </p>

                  <p className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 pt-6">
                    Above all we will stay humble and grateful.
