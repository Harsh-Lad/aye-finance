              <p>
                Many small and micro businesses in India face a huge obstacle to
                their progress â€“ lack of access to capital. Many of them are in
                unorganized sectors, do not maintain detailed business accounts,
                do not have any credit history and loan needs are often very
                small. Formal credit providers have shunned them because it is
                not easy to underwrite these loans.
              </p>

              <p>
                Aye has picked up the gauntlet to break this vicious cycle. As
                the conventional data sets were not available, we pioneered a
                method that relies on using the unique patterns of an industry
                cluster backed by our time-tested data science models. Our
                ability to underwrite these 'edge' cases, where little formal
                data exists, differentiates us in our markets.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our strength goes beyond just technology. We have a deep branch
                network and a large team spread across the country. Our 'high
                tech, high-touch' approach has helped us reimagine and expand
                the boundaries of possibilities for our unique clientele.
              </p>

              <p>
                We have gone beyond being a lender and helped these businesses
                in market development, quality management and financial
                competence. Thanks to this all-round approach, we have seen
                positive social impact in cross-sectional studies done to
                evaluate the impact on our customers.
              </p>

              <p>
                We do not want to be merely recognized for what we have done but
                also for how we have done it. We will not hesitate to explore
                and experiment, we will keep our customers at the center of all
                that we do, we will always be honest and worthy of trust placed
                in us by our investors and regulators and we will always strive
                to make a difference to the communities we serve.
